				<!--Fill out Market Size-->
				<p>Ice Hockey participation in the US has been trending upwards since the 90Ã­s according to USA Hockey seeing growth rates of 8.63% and 14.28% over 5 and 10 year periods, respectively. However given the large rate, the sport only has 2,421,000 total participants accordingly to SFIA.</p>


				<p>The sport is overwhelmingly dominated by males, making up 74.7% of total participation. The most populated age demographic is 6-17 year olds, accounting for 41.2% of the total core participants</p>
				<p>Geographically, the sport is ruled by the colder climate. The Great lakes region, the Mid-Atlantic, and the New England regions account for the overwhelming majority of participants.</p>

					<h4>Governing Body Requirements: High</h4>
				</div>
				<p>USA hockey oversees the entire club hockey scene. Regional affiliates host sponsored tournaments that team within the region travel to play. They also have state, regional, and national competitions every year to determine the best teams for each age group as well as provide exposure to the players.</p>
				<p>At these USA Hockey sponsored tournaments, scorekeepers are required at each game to track the basic statistics and submit these to the tournament officials after the game. </p>

				<div class="alert alert-success" role="alert">
					<h4>Team vs Individual: High</h4>
				</div>
				<p>While at the most basic level the scoring of hockey is one team's goals against the other, there is a high level of individual scoring that can be kept by separate scorekeepers. However the official scorekeeper is only responsible for tracking goals, penalties, and substitutions.</p>


				<!--Copy starting below here for another subfactor -->

				<div class="alert alert-success" role="alert">
					<h4>Team Size: High</h4>
				</div>
				<p>Ice Hockey teams are sized ranging from 12-15 players with 6 on the ice at all times.</p>
					
				<div class="alert alert-warning" role="alert">
					<h4>Team Composition: Medium</h4>
				</div>
				<p>The statistics for all players on the rink are the same except for goalie are the same. The goalie has separate statistics that make for more in-depth and diverse numbers.</p>

				<div class="alert alert-warning" role="alert">
					<h4>Acceptance for Technology: Medium</h4>
				</div>
				<p>At the professional level, the NHL has begun to implement player tracking to analyze things such as puck possession and defensive positioning. While this won't be in the youth game for a long time, the overwhelming amount of young players leads to an overall culture of acceptance for technology</p>

				<div class="alert alert-warning" role="alert">
					<h4>Appreciation for Statistics: Medium</h4>
				</div>
				<p>While hockey provides an opportunity for in-depth statistical analysis similar to basketball, it is ultimately up to the coach what statistics he/she deems necessary. Overall, the culture in hockey is shifting towards one with a greater appreciation for stats.</p>

				<div class="alert alert-warning" role="alert">
					<h4>Demand for Content: Medium</h4>
				</div>
				<p>At the professional level, play by play and individual player statistics have become the norm. There is nothing like this currently at the youth level leaving a clear gap in individual player tracking, thus creating a demand.</p>

				<div class="alert alert-success" role="alert">
					<h4>Game Clock: High</h4>
				</div>
				<p>Ice hockey has 3 periods, varying in length from 15-20 minutes each. Throughout the game, stats such as penalties and goals are charted for the minute in which they happen. At the younger ages, the clock is often stopped for substitutions.</p>


				<div class="alert alert-success" role="alert">
					<h4>Field Position: High</h4>
				</div>
				<p>Throughout the game, players are constantly moving around the ice. In this category, hockey is very similar to basketball as it is important to track where shots are taken from in order to gain an understanding of tendencies that are more successful.</p>


				<div class="alert alert-success" role="alert">
					<h4>Pace of Game: High</h4>
				</div>
				<p>On such a small rink with the puck hovering on ice, the pace of play for hockey is one of the quickest. Thus having a device that could make scoring quicker and easier would be very beneficial.</p>

				<div class="alert alert-success" role="alert">
					<h4>Benefit of Automation: High</h4>
				</div>
				<p>By automating scoring, it would cut out the need for a scorekeeper at tournaments and would allow for a more in-depth analysis of statistics including assists, goalie stats, and tendencies.</p>

				<div class="alert alert-success" role="alert">
					<h4>Competition: High</h4>
				</div>
				<p>With many scoring apps beginning to enter the market, there would be a high barrier of entry to ice hockey. However, compared to these other apps, GameChanger and its capabilities blow them out of the water.</p>

				<div class="alert alert-warning" role="alert">
					<h4>Benefits from Live Updates: Medium</h4>
				</div>
				<p>Fans and parents watching live from home will be able to follow big events throughout the game such as shots, saves, goals, and penalties. Due to the pace of play being so high, there would be no way to keep updated on everything happening.
