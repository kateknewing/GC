					<h4>Governing Body Requirements: High</h4>
				</div>
				<p>There is a nationwide organization the <b>USTA</b> (United States Tennis Association), which provides a way for schools to bring tennis programs to their schools. They provide <b>services for all age groups</b> and use a system called TennisLink to connect everyone, manage leagues, and offer a place to upload their stats too. </p>


				<div class="alert alert-warning" role="alert">
					<h4>Team Size: Medium</h4>
				</div>
				<p>The size of tennis teams range from <b>7 - 12 participants</b>. This is all dependent on the age group with juniors having an average of 8 and high/college around 11 players.</p>

				<div class="alert alert-danger" role="alert">
					<h4>Team Composition: Low</h4>
				</div>
				<p>Athletes are scored individually and the results of their matches count toward the team score. There are <b>no separate stats</b> recorded for <b>singles or doubles</b>, because there are no distinct positions.</p>

				<div class="alert alert-danger" role="alert">
					<h4>Team vs. Individual: Low</h4>
				</div>
				<p>Tennis is an <b>individual  sport</b> where players contribute to the final score, they are the deciding factor for if the team receives  points. There is some opportunity  for <b>analytics</b>, but they would only be <b>useful after the match, since coaches are unable to advise their player during a match</b>. However, coaches and players would <b>want to see the stats for upcoming  opponents</b>, so they could prepare appropriately.

					<h4>Acceptance of Technology: High</h4>
				</div>
				<p>In the professional leagues tennis has Hawk-Eye which tracks the tennis ball and player's positioning on the court. <b>IBM's PointStream</b> technology provides <b>analytic assessments</b> of players and statistics. <b>3D technology</b> has been used to track a player's movement and <b>determine the risk for injury</b> for each serve.</p>

				<div class="alert alert-danger" role="alert">
					<h4>Appreciation for Statistics: Low</h4>
				</div>
				<p>Tennis at the professional level has the ability to access advanced analytics, but at the <b>youth level</b> the game is <b>so fast</b> that only the <b>score of each set is recorded</b>. More advanced stats could be recorded, but <b>paper and pencil</b> only allows <b>minimal scoring</b>.</p>

				<div class="alert alert-success" role="alert">
					<h4>Demand for Content: Medium</h4>
				</div>
				<p>Tennis <b>scores are changing often enough</b> to where live updates would provide a <b>constant stream of information</b>. Live <b>advanced stats</b> would require for more <b>advanced technology</b> or a <b>better scoring systems</b> to be able to keep track of the match, since tennis is one of the fastest scoring sports.</p>

				<div class="alert alert-danger" role="alert">
					<h4>Field Position: Low</h4>
				</div>
				<p>Positioning in tennis <b>is of no relevance</b>, because matches happen between 2 - 4 players on one court. Doubles does require positioning, but no distinct stats are taken for the front and back players.</p>
				

				<div class="alert alert-danger" role="alert">
					<h4>Game Clock: Low</h4>
				</div>
				<p><b>No time</b> is kept in tennis, so a player keeps on playing until a match has been decided.</p>

				<div class="alert alert-success" role="alert">
					<h4>Pace of Game: High</h4>
				</div>
				<p>Tennis has a <b>fast pace</b> with <b>constant scoring and player actions</b> happening on the court. Advanced stats could be recorded every 1-2 seconds, because  of the back and forth racketing of the ball.</p>

				<div class="alert alert-success" role="alert">
					<h4>Benefit from Automation: High</h4>
				</div>
				<p>Scorekeepers could keep <b>track of the types of returns and serves</b>. For example if it was a back hand return, which resulted in a fault. Also <b>tracking where the ball had landed</b> would provide insight into a player's accuracy.</p>

Track Tennis provides a way to score a tennis game via a mobile device and record more in-depth stats. Lastly, Tennis Trakker provides visualization tools for stats recorded on the app. </p>
				<p>The market is most of the basis covered with <b>Tennis Link</b> being the most widely accepted with a <b>330,000 users</b>.</p>
				<div class="alert alert-success" role="alert">
					<h4>Benefits from Live Updates: High</h4>
				</div>
				<p>Live tennis updates would be <b>extremely  useful</b>, because the game <b>happens so fast</b>. There is <b>constant action and scoring</b> on the court with the <b>ability to track</b> these events given better tools. This would result in a <b>constant stream of live updates</b> that could be provided to fans.</p>
