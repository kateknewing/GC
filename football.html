				<p>Football is the sport with the highest participation at the high school level. According to NFHS, <b>1,094,949</b> high school athletes played football in the 2013-2014 school year. This accounts for <b> 14% of total high school sports </b>participation. According to SFIA, football has the highest percent of core participants out of the other 10 sports.</p>

				<p>Football has seen a decrease in growth - down 2.5% in total core participation and down 1.4% in high school participation.</p>

				<!-- This is the subfactor header

					<h4>Governing Body Requirements: Low</h4>
				</div>
				<p>There are some nationwide youth programs such as Pop Warner and American Youth Football but no large encompassing organization that extends past the youth level. Neither youth organization requires score reporting but both youth leagues have a national championship that brings a few teams from different regions together.</p>


				<div class="alert alert-success" role="alert">
					<h4>Team Size: High</h4>
				</div>
				<p>Football teams usually have large teams. At the professional level the roster is about 50 people. Youth leagues normally are limited by participation but given there are enough sign ups they average about 30 people per team (11 for both offense and defense, a kicker, a punter, and a few subs).</p>

			

				<div class="alert alert-success" role="alert">
					<h4>Team Composition: High</h4>
				</div>
				<p>Football has many different positions all which require different statistics to be kept about that player. There are three separate teams for offense, defense, and special teams, and even more differentiation between players within the team.</p> 
				<p>GameChanger can benefit from this by easing the burden of collecting so many different statistics and also by offering unique analysis to provide insight to coaches.</p>

			

				<div class="alert alert-success" role="alert">
					<h4>Team vs. Individual: High</h4>
				</div>
				<p>Football is a team sport with lots of opportunity for analysis based on player interaction. Coaches will benefit from insight on what quarterback/receiver teams have the most success together. Even though there are many individual statistics kept about football they all pertain to the same play and the same game.</p>

				<div class="alert alert-success" role="alert">
					<h4>Acceptance of Technology: High</h4>
				</div>
				<p>At a professional and college level, football teams are employing new technologies like sensors in pads to track players on the field, wearable technology, and tablet playbooks. Even at the high school level some teams use a company that allows them to upload game film to a cloud server and edit and add comments to send back to players. </p>

				<div class="alert alert-success" role="alert">
					<h4>Appreciation for Statistics: High</h4>
				</div>
				<p>With so many unique positions, there are a lot of statistics to be kept in football and a lot are used in reporting games. Fans have a desire to see statistics in the media. There are widely used advanced statistics - such as QBR  rating - and also other advanced analytics that are starting to become more widely used.  </p>


			

				<div class="alert alert-success" role="alert">
					<h4>Demand for Content: High</h4>
				</div>
				<p>There is definitive content generated during every play of the game. Every single play can be analyzed to gain some insights about the way the game was played and what can be done differently next time. This means there is a lot of data collected and all of it is relevent in analyzing the game. </p>

				<div class="alert alert-success" role="alert">
					<h4>Field Position: High</h4>
				</div>
				<p>Field position is very important in football because a team needs to gain a certain number of yards on the field in order to ultimately score. Scorekeepers need to record on which yard line each aspect of the play takes place to determine passing yards, running yards, and other statistics.</p>
				

				<div class="alert alert-success" role="alert">
					<h4>Game Clock: High</h4>
				</div>
				<p>Football requires stopping and starting the clock between every play. There's also a game clock that determines the maximum time between plays before a penalty is given. Clock management is a very important part of football strategy.</p>



				<div class="alert alert-warning" role="alert">
					<h4>Pace of Game: Medium</h4>
				</div>
				<p>While the play is live there is a lot of data to be collected very quickly but there is a lot of downtime in between plays that slows down the pace of the game and gives scorekeepers time to catch up.</p>

			

				<div class="alert alert-success" role="alert">
					<h4>Benefit from Automation: High</h4>
				</div>
				<p>Scorekeepers have to record a lot of different information for each play - whether it was a pass or run, whether it was completed, how many yards, who was involved - in addition to recording individual passing and rushing stats. By inputting the roster ahead of time, a scorekeeper can easily select the players involved in the play and then the individual statistics will be automatically compiled.</p> 
			<p>By using a visual representation of the playing field to record plays it will automate the process of recording yardage.</p>

				<div class="alert alert-success" role="alert">
					<h4>Existing Competition: High</h4>
				</div>
				<p>There are many existing football scorekeeping and statistics recording apps. Some include iScore, iTouchStats, and TurboStats to name a few. There are also many other websites and apps that offer similar services.  Some are aimed towards scouts and some offer team management features such as communication with players and live updates. </p>
				<div class="alert alert-success" role="alert">
					<h4>Benefits from Live Updates: High</h4>
				</div>
				<p>Football's structure allows for meaningful updates of the state of the game after each play. The finite nature of plays easily facilitates play-by-play updates. This technology is widely used at professional and college levels and in some other youth sports applications.</p>
