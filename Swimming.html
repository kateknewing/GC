					Change "alert-success" to "alert-danger" if your sport scored low in this subfactor, this will change the box to red. Change "alert-success" to "alert-warning" if your sport score medium in this subfactor, this will make the box to yellow.

				<div class="alert alert-success" role="alert">
					<h4>Governing Body Requirements: High</h4>
				</div>
				<p>There is a very strong central governing body in swimming. USA Swimming is responsible for selecting and training the Olympic team but they have member teams ranging from age 5 to adult. USA Swimming requires the scores from each meets to be reported and kept in its database. USA Swimming also keeps a record of fastest times for each event.
</p>


				<div class="alert alert-danger" role="alert">
					<h4>Team vs. Individual: Low</h4>
				</div>
				<p>Each swimmer is scored individually. At swim meets, many swimmers on the same team could be competing in different events at the same time so it would be impossible for one coach to score his entire team. 
</p>				<!--Copy starting below here for another subfactor 

				<div class="alert alert-success" role="alert">
					<h4>Team Size: High</h4>
				</div>
				<p>Swim teams are usually large because they contain many different age groups who all operate as one organization. The size varies depending on the area and the team but the largest teams have a few hundred participants. 
</p>


				-->

				<div class="alert alert-danger" role="alert">
					<h4>Team Composition: Low</h4>
				</div>
				<p>The same data is collected about each swimmer. There are no unique positions that have unique statistics.

				<div class="alert alert-danger" role="alert">
					<h4>Acceptance of Technology: Low</h4>
				</div>
				<p>Many swim meets use electronic touch pads in the pool to record the exact time a swimmer finished a raace but not many other technological advances.
</p>


				<div class="alert alert-danger" role="alert">
					<h4>Appreciation for Statistics: Low</h4>
				</div>
				<p>There are not many statistics commonly used in swimming due to the simplified scoring system.
</p>

				<!--Copy starting below here for another subfactor 

				<div class="alert alert-danger" role="alert">
					<h4>Demand for Content: Low</h4>

				<div class="alert alert-danger" role="alert">
					<h4>Game Clock: Low</h4>
				</div>
				<p>Though individual races are timed, swimming competitions are not timed as a whole so keeping track of time is not an issue.
</p>

				<div class="alert alert-danger" role="alert">
					<h4>Field Position: Low</h4>
				</div>
				<p>Field position is not something that can be tracked or that is relevant in the sport of swimming. </p>


				<!--Copy starting below here for another subfactor 

				<div class="alert alert-danger" role="alert">
					<h4>Pace of Game: Low</h4>
				</div>
				<p>There's only one data point collected at the end of each heat in a swim meet so there is no contiuous game.</p>

				-->

				<div class="alert alert-danger" role="alert">
					<h4>Benefit from Automation: Low</h4>
				</div>
				<p>There is little data collection about the competition so there are not many possibilites ot benefit from automation.

					<h4>Existing Competition: Low</h4>
				</div>
				<p>There is a widely used existing system that offers swim meet management tools such as sign up, seeding, and score aggregation as well as apps for coaches to manage communication and payment and for parents that allows them to see their child's scores.
</p>

				<div class="alert alert-success" role="alert">
					<h4>Benefits of Live Updates</h4>

				<p>Fan experience would not be very enriched from live updates because the final score is the only update they would receive. </p>
