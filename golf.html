				<!--Fill out Market Size-->
				<p>High school participation for golf is relatively low at <b>223,638 participants</b> in 2013, and the 5-year growth rate is also a lackluster -1.67%. The percentage of participants that come from households that earn over $75,000 a year is towards the higher end of the specturm at 55%. This is the demographic that is most likely to purchase the app.</p>

				<div class="alert alert-danger" role="alert">
					<h4>Governing Body Requirements: Low</h4>
				</div>
				<p>The governing body of golf in the U.S. is the U.S. Golf Association, which is responsible for organizing amateur tournaments.</p>

				<div class="alert alert-danger" role="alert">
					<h4>Team vs Individual Scoring: Low</h4>
				</div>
				<p>Golf teams receive scores based on the performance of individual team members, making a digital scoring app for a golf team less useful than for other team sports.</p>
				
				<div class="alert alert-warning" role="alert">
					<h4>Team Size: Medium</h4>
				</div>
				<p>Golf teams tend to be around <b>10 people</b>, which is small compared to other amateur teams. The team size is too small for there to be much demand for content and too big for coaches to be able keep track of the players on the course to record statistics. </p>

				<div class="alert alert-danger" role="alert">
					<h4>Team Composition: Low</h4>
				</div>
				<p>The same stats are recorded for every player, which takes away some of the benefit for a digital scorekeeping app. Recording stats by hand for every player is as simple as writing down the score for each whole.</p>

					<h4>Subfactor: Score</h4>

				<p>Here is another paragraph yay.</p>

				<div class="alert alert-success" role="alert">
					<h4>Acceptance of Technology: High</h4>
				</div>
				<p>Golf has adopted technologies that include basic scorecard apps, GPS ball tracking technology and swing analysis tools, which shows the culture's willingness to experiment with new innovations.</p>

				<div class="alert alert-success" role="alert">
					<h4>Appreciation for Statistics: High</h4>
				</div>
				<p>Stats that could be recorded that provide insight include greens and fairways hit, putting percentage and bunkers hit. The capability to record these stats would be beneficial to individual players, fans and coaches.</p>

				<div class="alert alert-danger" role="alert">
					<h4>Demand for Content: Low</h4>
				</div>
				<p>Golf is a very slow-paced game so play-by-play would not be very beneficial. Displaying shot progression which shows how a golfer is performing on a hole would be a beneficial feature for individuals, coaches and fans. However, this would require a complete digital reconstruction of the course, which is infeasible.</p>

				<!-- Fill Out Pain Points -->

				<!-- This is the subfactor header

				--> 
				<div class="alert alert-danger" role="alert">
					<h4>Game Clock: Low</h4>
				</div>
				<p>No game time exists, which means recording data by hand in relation to a game clock is not a significant pain point.</p>

				<div class="alert alert-warning" role="alert">
					<h4>Field Position: Medium</h4>
				</div>
				<p>Pinpointing where on the field shots fall and creating a shot progression to follow how the individual performed on hole would be very beneficial for spectators and for coaches.</p>

				<div class="alert alert-danger" role="alert">
					<h4>Pace of Game: Low</h4>
				</div>
				<p>Because of the very slow pace, it is not difficult to record data by hand. A digital scorekeeping app would not be a huge upgrade from paper scorecards in terms of convenience because there is no pain point from writing down the stats.</p>

				<div class="alert alert-danger" role="alert">
					<h4>Benefits from Automation: Low</h4>
				</div>
				<p>There is not much room for automation in golf because the same statistics are recorded for every player, there are no substitutions and there is no game clock.</p>

				<div class="alert alert-warning" role="alert">
					<h4>Competition: Medium</h4>
				</div>
				<p>There are no apps geared towards providing multi-faceted digital scorekeeping for teams, but there are apps that fulfill the function of a basic scorecard.</p>

				<div class="alert alert-danger" role="alert">
					<h4>Benefit of Live Updates: Low</h4>
				</div>
				<p>Live updates would be difficult because a coach cannot follow every player on the course and so players would have to self report. Play-by-play would not be very useful because of the game's slow pace and low quantity of statistics.</p>
