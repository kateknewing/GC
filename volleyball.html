				<div class="alert alert-success" role="alert"><h4>Governing Body Requirements: High</h4></div>
				<p>The main governing body of amateur volleyball is <b>USA Volleyball (USAV)</b>. 
				At games there is an official scorekeeper and sometimes a secondary scorekeeper. The official scorekeeper is responsible for collecting and recording the starting lineup from each team at the start of each game. </p>
				<p>Some tournaments use software called <b>Advanced Entertainment Systems (AES)</b> to manage their tournament matching and event schedules. AES has an app on the app store but many users complain about the presence of ads. </p>
				<div class="alert alert-success" role="alert"><h4>Team versus Individual Scoring: High</h4></div>
				<p>Each game is played head to head between two teams, however at the more advanced level of league games they are usually part of larger tournaments where many teams come together and play on multiple courts.</p>
				<p>The score of the game is kept for the team overall. <b>The official scorekeeper is only responsible for keeping track of the overall score of the game</b>, not individual points or statistics.</p>
				<div class="alert alert-warning" role="alert"><h4>Team Size: Medium</h4></div>
				<p>Volleyball teams are moderately sized compared to other sports, the minimum team size is <b>eight players but there can be up to 16.</b></p>
				<div class="alert alert-success" role="alert"><h4>Team Composition: High</h4></div>
				<p>For official scoring, each position is tracked same way on the scoresheet except for the position of the libero. <b>The libero is a special position in indoor volleyball</b>; the libero must be in the game at all times and is not limited by the rules of rotation. The scorekeeper must make a special mark on the scoresheet whenever the libero serves.</p>

			    <div class="alert alert-warning" role="alert"><h4>Acceptance of Technology: Medium</h4></div>
				<p>There are rudimentary score keeping apps that exist for Volleyball which only let users keep track of the overall score. According to our interviews, it is not uncommon for parents to keep their own score during games using these apps to ensure the official score keeping is accurate.  </p>
				<p>At the professional level, companies such as VolleyMetrics record videos of games and give statistical analysis to accompany the footage. However, this service is very expensive and not accessible to amateur leagues.  </p>

				<div class="alert alert-warning" role="alert"><h4>Demand for Content: Medium</h4></div>
				<p>The gameplay style in volleyball would benefit from a play by play update system and based on our interviews there would be an interest in that type of reporting. However, implementing a system could prove difficult because of the pace of the game. There are existing products for post-game metrics in the professional market but not in the amateur markets.</p>

				<div class="alert alert-success" role="alert"><h4>Appreciation for Statistics: High</h4></div>
				<p>Collection of individual player statistics are present within the professional level reporting. For amateur leagues, the assistant manager will often keep track of individual statistics. However, there is no standardized set of statistics that are recorded or advanced statistics that are calculated. The benefit of the statistics in strategy also varies, as some teams do not utilize statistics to assist their gameplay or training. </p>

			    	<div class="alert alert-danger" role="alert"><h4>Game Clock: Low</h4></div>
			    	<p>No game clock is kept within volleyball</p>

			    	<div class="alert alert-success" role="alert"><h4>Field Position: High</h4></div>
			    	<p>The order and position of players within volleyball is very important. This is something that the official scorekeeper keeps track of and it is vital to the serving order of the game. </p>

			    	<div class="alert alert-success" role="alert"><h4>Pace of Game: High</h4></div>
			    	<p>Volleyball is an extremely high paced game. This can lead to many mistakes being made by the official scorekeeper if they are not experienced. There is a lot of offered training and videos teaching people how to score in volleyball, therefore there could be benefit in the practice scorekeeping tutorials that GameChanger offers.</p>

			    	<div class="alert alert-success" role="alert"><h4>Benefit from Automation: High</h4></div>
			    	<p>The scorekeeping method of volleyball is very tedious and many of the aspects of scorekeeping could be made more efficient through digitalization. The scorekeeper marks off each point that is made by the team by crossing of numbers that are printed on the sheet itself. </p><p>He or she must also make a special mark every time the libero has to serve. When substitutions are made there must be a mark to indicate which player was subbed and what the score was when the substitution happens. In general, there are multiple marks that have to be made when certain things occur during the game that could be automated by an app. </p>

			    	<div class="alert alert-success" role="alert"><h4>Competition: High</h4></div>
			    	<p>There is no widely accepted management software and although scoring apps exist, they are very rudimentary and donâ€™t allow for anything more advanced than simple score tracking. </p>

			    	<div class="alert alert-success" role="alert"><h4>Benefits for Live Updates: High</h4></div>
			    	<p>Fans would be interested in play by play updates because the sport moves quickly. There are many aspects of the game (kills, assists, sets etc.) that can be recorded and reported to fans. </p>
