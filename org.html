If the organization requires score reporting, GameChanger can simplify that process for leagues. The community of separate organizations across the nation also allows for early adopters of GameChanger to encourage fellow leagues to adopt.</p>

Team sports also offer opportunities for analysis based on interactions of players.</p>
