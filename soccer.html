					<h4>Governing Body Requirements: High</h4>
				</div>
				<p>U.S. Soccer is the governing body for the sport in America and the amateur market is run by its affiliate the <b>U.S. Youth Soccer Association (USYSA)</b>.</p>

				<p>There is no software currently distributed by U.S. Soccer or USYSA to record and report data, opening an opportunity for a digital scoring application.</p>

				<div class="alert alert-success" role="alert">
					<h4>Team vs Individual Scoring: High</h4>
				</div>
				<p>Soccer is a very <b>team-oriented sport</b> where scoring goals can only be done when teammates work together. The large team size makes passing and communication especially important.</p>
				
				<p>Games are played as head-to-head matches between two teams and tournaments are played elimination style. There is only a requirement to record final score and the cards (yellow and red) that individual players receive. No other individual or team statistics are required to be recorded.</p>

				<div class="alert alert-success" role="alert">
					<h4>Team Size: High</h4>
				</div>
				<p>Team Size varies by age group, but for a majority of leagues and age groups the recommended number of players on the field is 11 players. That translates to team sizes that range anywhere from <b>13 to 20 players on a team</b>.</p>

				<div class="alert alert-success" role="alert">
					<h4>Team Composition: High</h4>
				</div>
				<p>Offensive, midfield and defensive players are all tracked using the same statistics, though some stats are more relevant for certain positions. However, the goalie position has different stats to be recorded and is therefore scored separately from other position players. </p>

				<div class="alert alert-warning" role="alert">
					<h4>Acceptance of Technology: Medium</h4>
				</div>
				<p>In the past, FIFA, soccer's global governing body, has been reluctant to adopt new technology, such as goal-line sensors to determine goals. However, professional teams and college teams are experimenting with wearable technology, which the German national team claims played a role in its World Cup victory in 2014.</p>
				
				<p>Historically, soccer's culture has been slow to adopt new technology, but there are still <b>opportunities for digital scorekeeping applications</b> to alleviate current pain points and to add a new dimension to amateur soccer.</p>

				<div class="alert alert-Danger" role="alert">
					<h4>Appreciation for Statistics: Low</h4>
				</div>
				<p>Similar to "Acceptance of Technology," statistics has not historically been a significant factor in soccer. But new studies and statistical analysis are showing the benefit of tracking soccer statistics, which is ushering soccer into the age of data.</p>
	
				<p>The sport's ongoing transition into the digital and data-driven modern world opens up a lot of potential for a digital scorekeeping app in the youth market. </p>
				<div class="alert alert-success" role="alert">
					<h4>Demand for Content: High</h4>
				</div>
				<p>Play-by-play is prevalent in professional and college soccer. This type of live update announces everything other than passes, which would include fouls, penalties, corner kicks, goals, shots, etc.</p>

				<p>While players are only scored as a team, most plays involve individuals either scoring goals, missing shots or committing fouls. Knowing which individual players did what would be of interest to fans.</p>

				<div class="alert alert-warning" role="alert">
					<h4>Game Clock: High</h4>
				</div>
				<p>Soccer is played in two halves of varying time depending on age group. A majority of age groups play two halves that are between 30 and 45 minutes. The game clock is beneficial in the context of recording statistics in soccer because coaches and fans can get a feel for the progression of the game. This is something coaches will want to know so they can adjust strategy and substitutions, and something fans would like to know as well.</p>

				<div class="alert alert-success" role="alert">
					<h4>Field Position: High</h4>
				</div>
				<p>Where plays are happening on the field is useful in terms of where goals and shots are being taken from by both teams, where fouls are being committed, where opposing players are taking the ball away and stealing possession and other factors. Visualizing these plays can help a coach determine how to adjust strategy and will also be a benefit to fans.</p>

				<div class="alert alert-success" role="alert">
					<h4>Pace of Game: High</h4>
				</div>
				<p>Soccer is played at a very fast pace, especially at the younger ages before passing skills develop. This makes scorekeeping by hand a difficult task for coaches who also have to focus on actually coaching. The pace at which the game is played is a significant pain point that can be alleviated by a digital scorekeeping application.</p>

				<div class="alert alert-success" role="alert">
					<h4>Benefits from Automation: High</h4>
				</div>
				<p>Automating substitutions and when plays happens in relation to the game clock could be automated and would alleviate pain points from recording the data by hand. Automatically sorting statistics for the goalie and other position players would also make scorekeeping much easier.</p>

					<h4>Competition: Medium</h4>
				</div>
				<p>Digital scorekeeping for soccer is not covered by many applications, but iScore does currently have one available for $9.99 on the app store. It can be used to record everything down to individual passes, so this represents competition in the youth soccer scorekeeping market.</p>

				<div class="alert alert-success" role="alert">
					<h4>Benefit from Live Updates: High</h4>
				</div>
				<p>As mentioned in "Demand for Content," live updates in the form of play-by-play commentary would be beneficial to fans, and live updates of statistics on a mobile app would allow coaches to create and adjust strategy in real-time.</p>
