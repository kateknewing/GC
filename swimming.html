				<!-- This is the subfactor header
					Change "alert-success" to "alert-danger" if your sport scored low in this subfactor, this will change the box to red. Change "alert-success" to "alert-warning" if your sport score medium in this subfactor, this will make the box to yellow.

				<div class="alert alert-success" role="alert">
					<h4>Governing Body Requirements: High</h4>
				</div>
				<p>There is a very strong central governing body in swimming. <b>USA Swimming</b> is responsible for selecting and training the Olympic team but they <b>have member teams ranging from age 5 to adult</b>. USA Swimming <b>requires the scores</b> from each meets to be reported and kept in its database. USA Swimming also keeps a record of fastest times for each event.
</p>


				<div class="alert alert-danger" role="alert">
					<h4>Team vs. Individual: Low</h4>
				</div>
				<p>Each <b>swimmer is scored individually</b>. At swim meets, many swimmers on the same team could be competing in different events at the same time so it would be <b>impossible for one coach to score his entire team</b>. 
</p>			

				<div class="alert alert-success" role="alert">
					<h4>Team Size: High</h4>
				</div>
				<p>Swim teams are usually large because they contain many different age groups who all operate as one organization. The size varies depending on the area and the team but the <b>largest teams have a few hundred participants</b>. 
</p>


			

				<div class="alert alert-danger" role="alert">
					<h4>Team Composition: Low</h4>
				</div>
				<p>The same data is collected about each swimmer. There are <b>no unique positions that have unique statistics</b>.
</p>

				<div class="alert alert-danger" role="alert">
					<h4>Acceptance of Technology: Low</h4>
				</div>
				<p>Many swim meets use electronic touch pads in the pool to record the exact time a swimmer finished a race but not many other technological advances.
</p>


				<div class="alert alert-danger" role="alert">
					<h4>Appreciation for Statistics: Low</h4>
				</div>
				<p>There are not many statistics commonly used in swimming due to the simplified scoring system.
</p>

			

				<div class="alert alert-danger" role="alert">
					<h4>Demand for Content: Low</h4>
				</div>
				<p>The only content available is the <b>time a swimmer earned for each heat</b> and those are easily available already.

				<div class="alert alert-danger" role="alert">
					<h4>Game Clock: Low</h4>
				</div>
				<p>Though individual races are timed, <b>swimming competitions are not timed as a whole</b> so keeping track of time is not an issue.
</p>

				<div class="alert alert-danger" role="alert">
					<h4>Field Position: Low</h4>
				</div>
				<p>Field position is not something that can be tracked or that is relevant in the sport of swimming. </p>


			

				<div class="alert alert-danger" role="alert">
					<h4>Pace of Game: Low</h4>
				</div>
				<p>There's only one data point collected at the end of each heat in a swim meet so there is <b>no continuous game</b>.</p>

	

				<div class="alert alert-danger" role="alert">
					<h4>Benefit from Automation: Low</h4>
				</div>
				<p>There is <b>little data collection</b> about the competition so there are not many possibilities to benefit from automation.

				<div class="alert alert-danger" role="alert">
					<h4>Existing Competition: Low</h4>
				</div>
				<p>There is a <b>widely used existing system</b> that offers <b>swim meet management tools</b> such as sign up, seeding, and score aggregation as well as apps for coaches to manage communication and payment and for parents that allows them to see their child's scores.
</p>

				<div class="alert alert-danger" role="alert">
					<h4>Benefits of Live Updates: Low </h4>
				</div>
				<p>Fan experience would not be enriched to much from live updates because the <b>final score is the only update they would receive</b>. </p>
