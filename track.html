				<!-- This is the subfactor header
					Change "alert-success" to "alert-danger" if your sport scored low in this subfactor, this will change the box to red. Change "alert-success" to "alert-warning" if your sport score medium in this subfactor, this will make the box to yellow.
				--> 
				<div class="alert alert-success" role="alert">
					<h4>Governing Body Requirements: High</h4>
				</div>
				<p>USA Track & Field oversees much of the club track scene. They have member associations but don’t require reporting to any specific database. USATF keep track of the best times and rankings by event and age group</p>

				<div class="alert alert-danger" role="alert">
					<h4>Team vs. Individual Scoring: Low</h4>
				</div>
				<p>Each event is scored individually. Depending on the place finished, each position is assigned a specific amount of points that goes towards the overall team score.</p>

				<!--Copy starting below here for another subfactor -->

				<div class="alert alert-success" role="alert">
					<h4>Team Size: High</h4>
				</div>
				<p>Track and field programs carry a large amount of athletes due to the different events and different age groups. Organizations often have 50+ athletes in total.</p>

				<div class="alert alert-danger" role="alert">
					<h4>Team Composition: Low</h4>
				</div>
				<p>While there are different events, each event is either scored by time or distance, thus creating a low opportunity for differentiation of statistics. </p>

				<div class="alert alert-warning" role="alert">
					<h4>Acceptance for Technology: Medium</h4>
				</div>
				<p>Track is beginning to gain traction at the more advanced levels for an appreciation for new technology. Electronic laser timing is used for many events as well as GPS tracking for some cross country events.</p>

				<div class="alert alert-danger" role="alert">
					<h4>Appreciation for Statistics: Low</h4>
				</div>
				<p>There are no statistics in track beyond time and distances so there is no real way to appreciate statistic</p>

				<!--Copy starting below here for another subfactor -->

				<div class="alert alert-danger" role="alert">
					<h4>Demand for Content: Low</h4>
				</div>
				<p>There is evidence of desire for play-by-play analysis at the youth level leaving a clear gap in individual player tracking.</p>

				--> 
				<div class="alert alert-danger" role="alert">
					<h4>Game Clock: Low</h4>
				</div>
				<p>There is no overall game clock for track and field meets, but rather just individual times.</p>

				<div class="alert alert-danger" role="alert">
					<h4>Field Position: Low</h4>
				</div>
				<p>Again, this category doesn’t score for track and field as participants are required to stay in their designated lanes.</p>

				<!--Copy starting below here for another subfactor -->

				<div class="alert alert-danger" role="alert">
					<h4>Pace of Game: Low</h4>
				</div>
				<p>There is no continuous play as there is only individual times for events.</p>

				<div class="alert alert-danger" role="alert">
					<h4>Benefit of Automation: Low</h1>
				</div>
				<p>By automating scoring, the only thing you would be able to do is have live updates on placement in races, which is fairly inconsequential. </p>

				--> 
				<div class="alert alert-danger" role="alert">
					<h4>Existing Competition: Low</h4>
				</div>
				<p>There is already many apps prevalent that have meet tracking software and keep a database of times for each meet scored using that software</p>

				<div class="alert alert-danger" role="alert">
					<h4>Benefits from Live Updates: Low</h4>
				</div>
				<p>The only way for live updates would be posting times after a race is completed which provides little ability for statistical analysis. </p>

				<!--Copy starting below here for another subfactor

				<div class="alert alert-success" role="alert">
					<h4>Subfactor: Score</h4>
