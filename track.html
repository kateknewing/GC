				<div class="alert alert-success" role="alert">
					<h4>Governing Body Requirements: High</h4>
				</div>
				<p><b>USA Track & Field</b> (USATF) oversees much of the club track scene. They have member associations but don’t require reporting to any specific database. USATF <b>keep track of the best times and rankings</b> by event and age group</p>

				<div class="alert alert-danger" role="alert">
					<h4>Team vs. Individual Scoring: Low</h4>
				</div>
				<p>Each event is scored individually. Depending on the place finished, each position is assigned a specific amount of points that goes towards the overall team score.</p>

				<!--Copy starting below here for another subfactor -->

				<div class="alert alert-success" role="alert">
					<h4>Team Size: High</h4>
				</div>
				<p>Track and field programs carry a <b>large amount of athletes</b> due to the different events and different age groups. Organizations often have <b>50+</b> athletes in total.</p>

				<div class="alert alert-danger" role="alert">
					<h4>Team Composition: Low</h4>
				</div>
				<p>While there are <b>different events</b>, each event is either <b>scored by time or distance</b>, thus creating a low opportunity for differentiation of statistics. </p>

				<div class="alert alert-warning" role="alert">
					<h4>Acceptance for Technology: Medium</h4>
				</div>
				<p>Track is <b>beginning to gain traction</b> at the more advanced levels for an appreciation of new technology. Electronic laser timing is used for many events as well as <b>GPS tracking</b> for some cross country events.</p>

				<div class="alert alert-danger" role="alert">
					<h4>Appreciation for Statistics: Low</h4>
				</div>
				<p>There are no statistics in track beyond time and distances so there is no real way to appreciate them.</p>

				<!--Copy starting below here for another subfactor -->

				<div class="alert alert-danger" role="alert">
					<h4>Demand for Content: Low</h4>
				</div>
				<p>There is evidence of desire for play-by-play analysis at the youth level leaving a <b>clear gap in individual player tracking</b>.</p>

				<div class="alert alert-danger" role="alert">
					<h4>Game Clock: Low</h4>
				</div>
				<p>There is <b>no overall game clock</b> for track and field meets, but rather just individual times.</p>

				<div class="alert alert-danger" role="alert">
					<h4>Field Position: Low</h4>
				</div>
				<p>Again, this category <b>doesn’t score for track and field</b> as participants are required to stay in their designated lanes.</p>

				<!--Copy starting below here for another subfactor -->

				<div class="alert alert-danger" role="alert">
					<h4>Pace of Game: Low</h4>
				</div>
				<p>There is <b>no continuous play</b> as there is only individual times for events.</p>

				<div class="alert alert-danger" role="alert">
					<h4>Benefit of Automation: Low</h1>
				</div>
				<p>By automating scoring, the only thing you would be able to do is have <b>live updates on placement in races</b>, which is fairly inconsequential. </p>

				<div class="alert alert-danger" role="alert">
					<h4>Existing Competition: Low</h4>
				</div>
				<p>There are many prevalent apps that have meet tracking software and keep a database of times for each meet scored using that software</p>

				<div class="alert alert-danger" role="alert">
					<h4>Benefits from Live Updates: Low</h4>
				</div>
				<p>The only way for live updates would be <b>posting times after a race</b> is completed which provides little ability for statistical analysis. </p>
